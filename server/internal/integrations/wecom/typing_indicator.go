// typing_indicator.go — WeCom's answer to "the bot heard you".
//
// Slack stamps 👀 on the user's message, Feishu a typing badge. WeCom has
// neither: the smart-bot protocol publishes no reaction, no read receipt and
// no typing signal at all. What it does have is the streaming message, so the
// same engine.TypingNotifier interface means something different here — the
// indicator IS the reply, opened early and filled in later. Two consequences
// follow from that, and both shape this file:
//
//   - The bubble MUST be closed. A reaction that never clears is untidy; a
//     stream that never finishes is a spinner sitting in the user's chat for
//     good. So every way a turn can end — answered, failed, cancelled, never
//     started — writes a closing frame carrying visible text into the bubble
//     while there is one.
//   - OnSettled is not the normal ending. As on the other platforms the Router
//     only calls it when the flush produced no task run; the answer closes the
//     bubble from the chat-done subscriber in outbound.go, which is the only
//     place that has the answer to close it with.
//
// WHICH RUN A BUBBLE IS WAITING FOR COMES OFF THE BUS. The engine tells this
// notifier that a message was ingested and nothing else — not which messages
// the debouncer collected together, not the task the flush created — so the run
// announces itself instead, on the task:queued every enqueue path already
// publishes (Register, handleTaskQueued). A bubble pairs with the run queued
// for its session while it was the one waiting, and from that binding every
// later ending matches by task id. The alternative was for the engine to carry
// two more facts through the Router for one platform's benefit.
//
// The bubble is a CACHE and nothing more (stream_store.go). A closer that
// finds one writes into it; one that does not says its words as an ordinary
// message where the words are worth saying — a failed run's notice — and stays
// silent where they are not. Nothing is owed on the strength of a bubble that
// is gone.
//
// TWO FRAMES PER ROUND, and no more: the opening one that paints the spinner,
// and the closing one that replaces it with the answer. The stream's own
// ten-minute window is counted from the opening frame and is not extended by
// anything written in between (streamMaxAge), so a run that outlives it loses
// its bubble and answers as an ordinary message — one message, whole. Filling
// the bubble in while the run is going, and carrying a long run over onto a
// fresh stream, are a separate layer on top of this one.

// offline, archived and issue_created and for nothing else. So a round with no
// bubble is addressed by the task's own delivery row, the way the answer is.

	// A ROUND ON THE OPEN LIST IS NOT PROOF OF ORIGIN, and it used to be read

	// writes NULL for every chat task — so the browser's run can hold the

	// front of everyone in the chat.
	//
	// The gate therefore runs for every ending. The order is what keeps it
	// cheap: task:failed fires for every run in the deployment — Slack's,

	// its answer is read three ways, not two:
	//
	//   routingSilent — another platform's run, or ours on a revoked
	//     installation. Nothing to say and nothing more to read: one lookup,
	//     which is what a foreign failure cost before the gate existed
	//     (TestAnotherChannelsFailureNeverReachesTheTaskRow).
	//   routingOurs — a live WeCom address. The row is itself the proof of

// per cancelled run, each on its own bubble, because the round is matched by
// the task id bindNext bound to it.
//
// This handler is only ever as complete as its publishers. It sees a cancelled
// run when service.TaskService broadcasts task:cancelled for the row —
// CancelTask, CancelQueuedChatTasks for the follow-ups behind it, the
// agent-level and issue-level bulk cancels, and BroadcastCancelledTasks for the
// handlers that cancel inside a transaction. A cancel path that flips the row
// and publishes nothing is invisible here, and the bubble it strands has no
// other closer: the daemon's own completion arrives after the row is already
// cancelled, where CompleteAgentTask's status = 'running' guard matches nothing
// and the answer is discarded without a chat:done. Archiving an agent used to
// be exactly that path (handler.ArchiveAgent).
//
// Unlike a failure this does NOT go looking for an address when no bubble is
// on file. StreamFailed is the only "that run did not go through" WeCom ever
// produces, which is why a failure is worth chasing an address for; a
