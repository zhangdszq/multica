//
// ONE read each time, and the assertion is an equality on both sides for that

// together, so the branch costs one round trip on top of the delivery lookup
// main already did. It was two — GetAgentTask, then the channel_ingested stamp

// from that branch and record skipNoDeliveryRow unconditionally — the cheap
