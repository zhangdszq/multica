// task_failed_test.go — what a failed run says in the chat, and who says it.
//
// #7952 established the words: the platform's own redacted reason, behind a
// warning mark, the way DingTalk and Lark deliver theirs. It sent them from
// Outbound, because at the time nothing else was listening.
//
// Here the typing indicator sends them instead, and that is not a preference:
// a failed run has a bubble waiting on it, and the indicator is the only
// party that can seal it. Sending from Outbound as well would put two messages
// in the chat for one failure — the bubble's ending and a plain message under
// it — which is what TestAFailedRunProducesExactlyOneMessage guards.
