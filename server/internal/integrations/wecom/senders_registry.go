// senders_registry.go — a small process-wide map from installation_id to
// live wsSender. wecomChannel.Connect adds an entry on entry and clears it
// on exit; OutboundReplier and Outbound look up by installation id to push
// aibot_send_msg over the same socket the inbound loop owns (aibot has no
// REST outbound path; every write goes over the WebSocket). wecomChannel.Send
// is not a reader — it returns ErrSendNotSupported.
//
// Why a registry rather than storing the sender on wecomChannel:
// OutboundReplier is created once at boot with the shared engine.Router
// and does not have per-installation Channel handles. When the engine
// invokes Replier.Reply, it passes engine.ResolvedInstallation carrying
// the installation id, not the Channel. The registry is the seam that
// lets the boot-time Replier reach the per-installation live connection
// without threading the Channel through the engine.

// stream writes one frame of a streaming reply to the bubble h describes.
//
// A stream frame is only meaningful while the req_id it echoes is still fresh,
// so a frame that cannot go out now is worthless later — there is nothing
// useful to do with it but report the failure and let the caller say the same
// words as an ordinary message instead.
//
// The sender is resolved HERE, per frame, rather than captured when the bubble
// opened, and that is load-bearing rather than redundant: a callback's req_id
// belongs to the TURN on WeCom's side, not to the connection it arrived on. A
// bubble opened before a reconnect is therefore finished after it, over
// whatever socket the installation holds by then, which is what lets a run
// outlive the connection its question came in on. Binding a connection at
// stream-open time reads like the obvious tightening and would strand the
// bubble on every reconnect — a failure that shows up only when the connection
// flaps, and never in a test.
//
// Measured 2026-08-09 against a live tenant, with our own backend stopped so
// nothing competed for the bot's socket: one connection took a real
// aibot_msg_callback, opened a stream on it and closed. A second connection,
// dialled and subscribed fresh, then refreshed that stream in place (same
// stream id) and opened a further one on the same req_id (new stream id) —
// errcode 0 both times, and both confirmed by reading the chat rather than by
// the errcode, since a server that accepts a frame and drops it looks the same
// on the wire.

// a separate key space, meaningful only on the connection that wrote them
// (ws_sender.go).

// recordEnding counts how a bubble ended — BOTH halves, recorded on this one
// line — from the final error of its closing frame.
//
// Every closer comes through here, via streamStore.seal: the answer, the
// failure and cancellation notices the typing indicator writes, and the
// settled flush. A closing frame the server took is a bubble that ended in
// words; one it refused sends the caller to a plain message instead, which is
// a fall-back at every call site without exception.
//
// The pair is recorded together because the pair is the signal — the ratio is
// what says whether the bubble still works at all — and a counter fed from one
// site while its twin is fed from two reads as a healthy ratio while a whole
// class of endings quietly stops using the bubble. That is what happened when
// the fall-back was counted in outbound.finishStream: the typing indicator's
// own closers never touched it, so a WeCom-side change that refused every
// closing frame would have shown up in the ratio only for answers, never for
// the failure and cancellation notices.
//
// Counted once per ending rather than once per attempt: seal may write the
// same closing frame several times when an ack is lost, and a bubble that
// took the frame on the second try ended in words all the same.
// recordOpened counts one bubble that is now on screen and owed an ending.

// an ending is known here, inside the seal; an opening is only known to the
// caller that decided to keep the handle.
