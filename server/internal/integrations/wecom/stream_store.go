// stream_store.go — the handles that let each answer land in the bubble its
// question opened.
//
// WeCom's aibot API has no typing indicator, no reaction, no read receipt, and
// no way to edit a message after the fact. The one affordance it does have is
// the streaming message: an aibot_respond_msg frame with finish=false paints a
// bubble the client renders as "working", and a later frame carrying the SAME
// stream.id replaces that bubble's body in place — finish=true seals it and
// nothing can touch it again
// (https://developer.work.weixin.qq.com/document/path/101463).
//
// THIS STORE IS A CACHE, NOTHING MORE. It maps a chat session to the bubbles
// that can still be written to. An ending that finds a writable bubble writes
// into it; one that does not goes out through the plain aibot_send_msg path
// that outbound.go already has, addressed by the task's own delivery row. A
// bubble that cannot be written to — never painted, past its window, lost to a
// restart, or refused by the server when the closing frame goes out — is
// simply not used. Nothing here records what was said, what is owed, or who
// was told; nothing owes anyone anything once the bubble is gone.
//
// A session holds a LIST of open bubbles, not one. Messages the engine's
// debouncer collects into one agent run share a bubble; a message it gives a
// run of its own gets a bubble of its own, queued behind the run in flight —
// immediately, because a message that produces nothing on screen reads as a
// message that was lost.
//
// WHICH RUN A BUBBLE STANDS FOR IS DECIDED HERE, from two facts that arrive on
// their own and in either order:
//
//   - A message was ingested (open). That is a bubble, and nothing more — at
//     that moment nobody knows whether the debouncer will answer it with a run
//     of its own or fold it into the one already collecting.
//   - A chat run was queued for this session (bindNext, driven by the
//     task:queued subscription in typing_indicator.go). That is a run, and
//     nothing more — the event names a task and a chat session and says
//     nothing about which message produced it.
//
// The pairing rule is position, and position alone: a queued run takes the
// OLDEST round that has no run yet, and a message joins the round that is
// still collecting rather than opening a second one. That works because the
// engine serializes a session's chat tasks (ClaimAgentTask) and its debouncer
// produces at most one run per window, so per session the two sequences are in
// step. Nothing here re-measures the debounce gap from arrival times: whether
// a message opens a round or joins one is read off "is a round still waiting
// for its run", not off a clock.
//
// The rounds are kept sorted by the store's own sequence number (insertLocked),
// which for one session is the order its bubbles were painted in, and that
// order IS consumed: bindNext and takeOldestUnbound both take the oldest
// unbound round.
//
// The event can beat the bubble. The Router detaches the ingest goroutine, and
// a session's first message enqueues its task inside dispatch (router.go's
// startChat path) rather than on the debounced flush, so task:queued routinely
// arrives before anything is painted. A run with no round to take waits in the
// session's pending queue and is picked up by the next bubble.
//
// The task id, once bound, is what every later lifecycle event matches on —
// never a position. An auto-retry clone carries a fresh id and inherits its
// parent's chat_input_task_id, which is this round's own task id: see
// roundTaker, which resolves the clone through it, and retryUnbind, which puts
// the round back in line for the clone's own task:queued so the clone never
// takes a bubble some other question opened.
//
// The catch is req_id. Every frame of one stream has to echo the req_id of the
// aibot_msg_callback that started the turn, and that value is only ever seen
// by the WebSocket read loop. The answer shows up minutes later on an event
// bus subscriber holding nothing but a chat_session_id. This store is the seam
// between the two: session in, {req_id, stream id, addressing} out.
//
// IN-MEMORY IS THE RIGHT STORAGE, and deliberately so. One bot is one long
// connection, and the Supervisor's WS lease already guarantees at most one
// replica holds it, so a handle is only ever useful in the process that
// created it. A restart loses the handles and the answers fall back to plain
// messages — degraded, not corrupted. Persisting them would be a trade rather
// than a fix: a stored handle still inside the window would be writable from
// the new process, at the cost of a row per bubble and a sweep to retire them,
// to save a fallback message on the restart that lands mid-run.
//
// A RECONNECT IS NOT A RESTART, and the difference is why this store is built
// once at boot, outside the connection loop (router.go). A handle outlives the
// socket it was made on, and WeCom scopes a callback's req_id to the turn
// rather than to that socket (measured 2026-08-09; sendersRegistry.stream
// carries the detail), so the bubble a question opened before a drop is closed
// by the answer over the next connection. A store rebuilt per connection, or
// emptied when one ends, would leave every reconnect's bubbles spinning with
// nothing left that could close them.
//
// Replay is not this file's problem. WeCom redelivers callbacks after a
// reconnect, but a redelivered frame loses the dedup claim in
// channel_inbound_message_dedup and never reaches OutcomeIngested, so it never
// reaches the typing indicator either. What this file does bound is the
// protocol's own window: a stream past streamMaxAge is refused by the server,
// and a handle past that age is worse than no handle at all — it would swallow
// the answer instead of delivering it.

// streamMaxAge is how long a handle is worth keeping: ten minutes, measured
// against the live tenant on 2026-08-09 rather than read off anyone's source.
// One stream was held open with our backend stopped and framed every thirty
// seconds until the server refused. It took the frame at 600.0s and refused
// the one at 630.0s with errcode 846608, errmsg "stream message update expired
// (>10 minutes), cannot update". So the true ceiling is somewhere in (600s,
// 630s] and this constant sits on its lower bound.
//
// The budget belongs to the STREAM, not to the req_id that carried it. The
// same probe sealed a first stream with finish=true at two minutes and opened
// a second on the same req_id with a fresh stream id: the second was still
// being accepted at eight minutes old, well past the first one's own
// ten-minute mark, and died at its own.
//
// So the clock is not something a bubble can be kept alive against: a run
// longer than the window loses its bubble and its answer goes out as an
// ordinary message. Carrying a round over onto a fresh stream is a separate
// layer on top of this one.

// separately: the clock ran while frames were landing every thirty seconds.

// seal writes a bubble's closing frame and is the one place the retry policy

//
// The policy, measured against the live bot (STRATEGY §6.5):
//
//   - An ack that never comes (errStreamAckTimeout) says nothing about whether
//     the frame landed, and a frame written right before a disconnect does
//     NOT land. Re-sending the identical closing frame is accepted with errcode
//     0 whether or not the first one did, so the frame is written again, up to
//     streamCloseRetries more times, streamCloseRetryDelay apart. The registry
//     resolves the sender per frame, so a reconnect between two attempts is
//     covered. THE CHOSEN SIDE: a retry after an ack that was merely lost may
//     put in front of the user a closing frame they have already seen — the
//     same content on the same stream, which the client renders in place. That
//     is preferred over the alternative, an answer written before a drop that
//     never arrived and was never sent again.
//   - A verdict from the server (streamUnusable: 846605 / 846608) ends it: this
//     stream will never take a frame, and the caller falls back to a plain
//     message.
//   - errStreamBusy and errStreamSuperseded are not retried. Busy cannot
//     happen to a closing frame (they queue, ws_sender.go); superseded means
//     another closer sealed this stream first, and the answer is theirs.
//   - The retries stop when ctx ends or the stream's own window is gone: a
