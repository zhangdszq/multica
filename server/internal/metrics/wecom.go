// WecomMetrics is the production sink behind the WeCom adapter's Metrics
// interface (server/internal/integrations/wecom/metrics.go).
//
// The adapter is built to degrade quietly. A dial that fails and a handshake
// the server refuses both yield the connection back to the Supervisor, which
// backs off and tries again; an ingest queue the read loop has to wait on
// yields nothing and simply stops draining the socket until the worker
// catches up. None of the three changes anything an operator can see. A bot
// that has been down since Tuesday and a bot nobody happened to message today
// produce the same silence.
//
// The two connection counters are deliberately separate. A dial or a read that
// fails is infrastructure and usually recovers on its own; a handshake the
// server refuses on its merits is a wrong secret or a deleted bot, and it will
// repeat identically on every backoff until a person fixes the installation.
// Summed into one number the operator cannot tell "wait" from "rotate the
// credential".
//
// Which side of that line an ack falls on is classifySubscribeAck's call, in
// the adapter, and this package only counts the verdict. An ack it cannot
// verify — a throttle, a platform-side failure — is a connect failure, on the
// "wait" side, because rotating a credential that was fine costs a second
// outage.
//
// No installation_id label anywhere. It is the same class of unbounded
// identifier as workspace_id and session_id, which forbiddenMetricLabels
// rejects outright. Attribution falls to the structured logs and is uneven
// there: the two connection failures reach the Supervisor as a returned error
// and are logged with installation_id, while a blocked ingest queue is
// counted and nothing else — the counter says some bot is behind, not which.
// The outbound counters answer a different question from the connection ones,
// and it is the question GH #7215 and #6890 were filed as: a reply was
// produced, the transcript has it, and the WeCom chat stayed quiet. Several
// unrelated causes end that way and from the chat they are one symptom, so
// each is counted where an operator can act on it: a frame the platform
// refused, or no socket for this installation in this process, is a drop; a
// turn that originated in the web UI, or an installation revoked between
// trigger and reply, was never owed to WeCom and is a skip; a frame whose
// verdict never came back may already be on the user's screen and is
// unconfirmed, not a drop. Delivered is the denominator: without it, a drop
// rate of zero and a bot nobody messaged look identical, which is the same
// ambiguity the connection counters exist to remove.
//
// reason is a closed set (wecom/outbound_outcome.go). It is the only label
// here, and it stays bounded by construction — no installation, workspace or
// session id, same rule as everywhere else in this package.
