// openclawCLITimeout is the default context deadline set on each

//
// It used to be 5s, on the assumption that the CLI answers in <200ms and 5s is
// pure cold-start headroom. Field data (#7112) retired that assumption: on a
// 2020 Intel MacBook Pro, `openclaw config file` takes 8.4–10.9s and
// `config get agents.list --json` 4.3s, every time — so the runtime was
// unusable on that host, with no user-side way to raise the limit. For scale,
// the same commands take 0.7s / 0.3s on an M-series Mac, i.e. the real spread
// across supported hardware is wider than the old margin.
//
// 30s is ~3x the slowest measured call, and even the worst case
// (openclawMaxCLIDeadlinesPerPreparation serial steps at that budget) fits
// inside the outer 5-minute task preparation deadline, so a genuinely hung CLI
// fails with this specific, actionable reason instead of the generic prepare
// timeout. Hosts outside that envelope can override with
// MULTICA_OPENCLAW_CLI_TIMEOUT (or backends.openclaw.cli_timeout in the CLI
// config, which the daemon translates into the same env var).
//
// The gap that used to be documented here — that this was a deadline and not a
// cap — is closed as of MUL-5467. Keeping the measurements, because they are
// what the fix has to hold against: CommandContext kills only the direct child,
// and cmd.Output() blocks in Wait() until the stdout pipe closes, so a CLI that
// leaves a descendant holding stdout ran for the descendant's lifetime.
// Measured on linux/dash: a shim whose backgrounded child slept 6s took 6.01s
// against a 150ms deadline. An npm shim is that shape on Windows (cmd.exe →
// node). A cmd.WaitDelay backstop bounded the call but left the descendant
// running (measured: returns in 2.17s with the grandchild still in state S),
// trading a hang for a process leak, and on Unix nothing reaped it because
// preparationProcessController.finish() is a no-op there.
//
// execOpenclawCLI goes through agent.RunCollectQuiet, which owns the pipes and
// the process tree (Unix process group, Windows Job Object). Owning the pipes is
// what makes the deadline enforceable: os/exec's own Wait cannot return while a
// descendant holds an output pipe, so the bound has to come from somewhere else,
// and a caller-side bound that reports failure would fail a call whose answer
// arrived. Owning the tree is what stops the descendant becoming an orphan.
//
// Two limits on that claim, both deliberate:
//
//   - "Enforceable", not "nothing survives": `openclaw-config` was measured with
//     its own PGID and SID, so on Unix no group signal reaches it. The deadline
//     holds anyway, because it is pipe ownership rather than the kill that makes
//     the call return.
//   - Returning before the CLI exits requires a completeness rule that the CLI's
//     pre-answer output cannot satisfy, which in practice means `--json` (see
//     openclawOutputComplete). Without one — `config file` as the fallback — this
//     deadline is what the call is bounded by, and reaching it is a failure. That
//     is a deliberate trade: an earlier revision judged `config file`'s stdout by
//     shape and review showed it returning a path-shaped *warning* line as the
//     answer.

//
// The three steps, in the order they can fire:
//
//  1. locate the active config — `config validate --json`, then `config file`
//     if that did not answer. Two invocations, one deadline: they ask the same
//     question and openclawActiveConfigPath shares a context between them
//     precisely so the fallback cannot add a fourth budget.
//  2. read the per-agent config the schema is willing to show —
//     `config get agents.list --json` (pre-2026.6 `agents.list[]`), then
//     `config get agents.entries --json` (2026.8+ `agents.entries.<id>`) when
//     the first path is gone. Two invocations, one deadline, for the same
//     reason as (1): both ask what the config schema carries per agent, and
//     the second is only reached when the first reported no such path.
//  3. `agents list --json`              — 2026.6+ registry fallback, only
//     reached when (2) reports that neither config path exists
//
// It was four until managed MCP stopped reading the user's config: the reset
// stage is a file this package writes, so a managed-MCP agent now costs the same
// CLI time as any other. Adding a fourth deadline-bearing step means re-deriving
// the ceiling. The worst-case test counts distinct deadlines rather than calls,
// so a new invocation that shares an existing budget is free and one that brings

// (and every `agents.list[].workspace`) to the task workdir — which is
// what makes OpenClaw's native skill scanner pick up the per-task skills
// we write under `<workDir>/skills/`.
//
// Strategy: delegate JSON5 / $include / env-substitution / state-dir
// resolution to the openclaw CLI itself rather than re-implementing the
// spec. We:
//
//  1. Run `openclaw config file` to find the user's active config path.
//     For OpenClaw releases whose `config` command rejects the `file`
//     subcommand shape, fall back to resolving OpenClaw's active-config
//     candidates, including legacy Clawdbot/Moltbot/Moldbot locations.
//  2. Run `openclaw config get agents.list --json` to enumerate every
//     registered agent ID with its resolved fields. The CLI parses JSON5,
//     follows $include, and substitutes ${VAR} for us.
//  3. Write a wrapper config to envRoot/openclaw-config.json that
//     `$include`s the active path and overrides
//     `agents.defaults.workspace` plus every `agents.list[].workspace` to
//     workDir. The original config bytes are not mutated — they are loaded
//     by openclaw's own loader through the $include link, which preserves
//     comments, secrets, and nested $include chains verbatim.
//
// **Cross-directory $include confinement.** OpenClaw confines `$include`
// resolution to the directory containing the wrapper file unless the
// target's parent is listed in `OPENCLAW_INCLUDE_ROOTS`. Our wrapper lives
// in envRoot but $includes the user's active config (typically
// `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`) — a cross-directory hop. We surface
// `filepath.Dir(activePath)` as IncludeRoot so the daemon can prepend it
// to whatever the user already has in OPENCLAW_INCLUDE_ROOTS; without
// this, OpenClaw refuses to follow the link and the wrapper boots with no
// user config. Fresh install emits no $include, so IncludeRoot is "".
//
// **Intentional task isolation.** The override of every per-agent workspace
// is deliberate. OpenClaw's resolution order is
// `agents.list[id].workspace → agents.defaults.workspace → ~/.openclaw/
// workspace`. Pinning only the default would let a per-agent workspace the
// user configured at host scope silently re-route the scanner back to the
// shared workspace, defeating the per-task skill discovery this whole flow
// exists for. The cost is that any per-agent SOUL.md / MEMORY.md / standing
// orders the user laid in `<host-agent-workspace>/` are NOT visible to the
// in-task openclaw run — task isolation wins over host carry-over. The
// user's on-disk config is untouched; this only affects the wrapper used
// for this single task.
//
// **Fail closed.** Missing openclaw binary, CLI errors, malformed CLI
// output, or any IO error during write surfaces as an error to the caller
// rather than degrading to a minimal config. An earlier version silently
// synthesized a minimal config on parse failure; that masked broken user
// configs by starting OpenClaw without the registered agents / model
// providers / API keys it expects, which led to tasks routing to the wrong
// agent or failing to authenticate. The only "synthesize minimal" case
// kept is a fresh install where the CLI reports a path but no file exists

	//     2026.6.34 (extended-stable) exit 1 in 2.9s with

	//     3.0s, 2026.8.1-beta.3 (beta) the same as a JSON envelope in 4.4s. So
	//     preparation failed for every managed-MCP task on every current channel.
	//     (2026.5.27 instead wrote zero bytes and never exited within 60s;
	//     #6275 made that shape fail predictably rather than hang, which is why
	//     it is adjacent to this fix and not a substitute for it.)
	//   - Even answered, the result is display data rather than a lossless
	//     round-trip: `runConfigGet` applies `redactConfigObject`, so a sensitive
	//     value comes back as the literal `__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__`. OpenClaw can
	//     restore that sentinel from the original file when it writes; this daemon
	//     cannot. Writing the remainder back would eventually overwrite a working

	//
	// Both disappear by not reading the config at all. The wrapper includes the

// is observed, copied, or dropped. See rewriteAgentsEntriesWorkspaces.

// expansion — so we prefer it when the installed CLI supports the command.
//
// `config validate --json` is asked first, and `config file` is only the
// fallback, because the two differ in whether the answer can be recognised:
//
//   - `config validate --json` puts the path in a named `path` field of a JSON
//     document, and its stdout is that document and nothing else. Measured on
//     OpenClaw 2026.7.1-2 with a warning-producing config: 715 bytes, one line,
//     parseable whole. The Doctor and plugin warnings do not disappear — they
//     arrive as a `warnings` array *inside* the payload, which is what keeps the
//     stream parseable rather than merely quieter. (Upstream also has a
//     console-log reroute for `--json` argv, `withConsoleLogsRoutedToStderrForJson`,
//     but the structured payload is what was observed doing the work here.)
//   - `config file` prints the path as its *last line*, after any Doctor and
//     plugin warnings, on stdout. Deciding "is the answer in yet" then means
//     asking whether the last line looks like a path — and a warning line that
//     names one is indistinguishable. Review demonstrated it: a stub printing an
//     existing `plugin-cache.json` path, then pausing, then printing the real
//     path had the warning accepted as the answer.
//
// Both commands perform the same `readConfigFileSnapshot()` read upstream
// (checked at `v2026.7.1`: `runConfigFile` prints `shortenHomePath(snapshot.path)`
// and `runConfigValidate` reports `snapshot.path`, `snapshot.exists` and
// `snapshot.valid` from that same snapshot), so validation is already part of the
// read `config file` does. Measured, the JSON form is not merely no worse but
// meaningfully cheaper: 1.65/1.66/1.65s against 6.36/4.16/4.06s for `config file`
// over three runs each on the same host and config, which tracks the output it
// does not have to render — 715 bytes of JSON against 2663 bytes and 28 lines of
// warning UI.
//
// `config validate --json` has carried the `path` field on every branch since
// `v2026.5.5`, which is minOpenclawVersion. Two of those branches exit non-zero —
// a missing file and an invalid config, both with the path in the payload and
// stderr empty — so the exit status must not be read as "no answer"; see
// openclawValidatedConfigPath.
//
// OpenClaw 2026.2.x briefly rejected `openclaw config file` with the generic
// "too many arguments for 'config'" error. For that command-shape failure only,
// fall back to the same active-config candidate shape so task prep can still
// continue without losing upgraded users' legacy config files.

// opaque parse error instead of the CLI's own message.

// isOpenclawKeyMissingResult recognizes the "you asked for a key that is not
// there" failures of `config get ... --json`. Which channel reports it where was
// measured on 2026-08-26, and the spread is why both transports stay supported:
//
//	2026.6.34   (extended-stable)  stderr text, stdout empty
//	2026.7.1-2  (latest)           stderr text, stdout empty
//	2026.7.2-beta.7                stdout {"error":"..."}
//	2026.8.1-beta.3 (beta)         stdout {"ok":false,"error":{"message":...}}
//
// So the stdout envelope is not "the new way" that replaced stderr — the current
// stable and latest channels are stderr-only, and only the beta line puts it on
// stdout. Dropping either transport breaks a channel that is shipping today.
//
// Wording also moved: 2026.6.34 and 2026.7.1-2 say "Config path not found: mcp",
// 2026.8.1-beta.3 says "Config path is valid but unset: mcp" for a key the schema
// knows and "Unknown config path: agents.list" for one it does not.
//
// Structured messages must name the path we asked for. That is what keeps a
// *usage* error out of this branch: the pathless `config get --json` form fails
// with `Missing required argument "path".`, which names no path and so cannot be
// read as an absent key. Cancellation and timeout keep their original meaning
// even if a child emitted a partial missing-path envelope before it stopped.
