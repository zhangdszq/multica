-- name: ListArchivedInboxItems :many
-- Archived counterpart of ListInboxItems, backing the inbox's "Archived"
-- sub-view (MUL-3736).
--
-- An issue whose group still has an active row is excluded: archiving is
-- issue-level, so a NEW notification on an already-archived issue leaves the
-- old archived rows in place alongside the fresh active one. The issue belongs
-- in the main inbox at that point, and the two lists must stay mutually
-- exclusive per issue group — otherwise the same issue renders in both. The
-- exclusion lives here rather than in the client so neither list depends on
-- the other's cache being loaded. Items without an issue_id group on their own
-- id and can never have an active sibling, hence the IS NULL short-circuit.
--
-- LIMIT applies to ISSUE GROUPS, not raw notification rows. Applying it after
-- the final SELECT lets one noisy issue consume all 200 rows and hide other
-- archived issues, which makes both the visible list and its count too small.
-- The response stays bounded at two rows per group: the newest row the UI
-- renders plus, when different, the newest row carrying a comment anchor. The
-- client already merges those two rows while deduplicating, preserving direct
-- comment landing without sending every historical notification in the group.
-- Keep the materialized working set narrow: full row data is joined only for
-- the final selected ids, not copied for every archived notification scanned.
